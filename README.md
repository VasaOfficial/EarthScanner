<h2>About</h2>

EarthSensor is a web application that allows users to search for a city and retrieve detailed information about its current air quality and weather conditions. The app visualizes the data using graphs and provides a 3D globe, built with ThreeJS, displaying stations with AQI (air quality index) levels higher than the norm.

This project was a way for me to learn a few cool libraries and frameworks that I have been eyeing out for a while. I wanted to try NextJS 13 and its routing, its SEO friendly ways and its SSR. It was a fun challenge to learn it and I feel confident in my skill with NextJS 13.

I had a lot of fun learning about THREE.JS and how to model dynamic data using vectors and geometries.

This project was also a great opportunity to include Tailwind CSS in order to make styling a bit faster, especially since I already had a lot to process learning WebGL. I also expanded my knowlege with React and Typescript with this project.

<h2>Features</h2>

- Search for a city to access real-time air quality and weather information.
- Interactive 3D globe visualization highlighting stations with higher AQI levels.
- User-friendly graphs presenting air pollution data in a visually appealing manner.
